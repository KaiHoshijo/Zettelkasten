# Linear Algebra Themes

Within the Linear Algebra class, there are two main themes: Uniqueness and Exisistence.

With the first theme, there is the question whether the system is unique or not. Since each system can have one solution, no solutions, or infinite solutions. If there is only one solution then the system is unique. On the other hand, the system is **not** unique if there are infinite solutions.

For the second theme, there is the question whether there *is* a solution for the system. Since the system can be parallel, there are times when there is no solutions to a system. This is based on the **consistency** of the system, where a system is consistent if there is one solution or infinite solutions. The system is **inconsistent** if there are no solutions.
