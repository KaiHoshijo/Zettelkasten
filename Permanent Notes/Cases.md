# Cases 
Rows of data, where each refers to a specific unique and similar unit of observations.

## Example
In a dataset about how many babies were given each name in each year in the US, the number of girls named Sherina in 1970 would be a case.

## Additionally details
Occasionally, each case can have repeating names or qualities, but it's important to keep in mind what makes each case unique. For example, for runners in races, the runnes will have multiple cases because each race is different. Thus, the case is a runner in one year's race rather than the runner themselves.
