# Interdependence Principle

This principle is based on how the best decision depends on one's other choices, choices from others, developments in other markets, and future expectations.

There are four interdependencies to consider:
    1. Dependeices between each of one's choices.
        a. Each person has limited resources, so decisions affect the resources for other actions. Some exaples of these limited resources are income, time, attention, production capability, or wealth.
    2. Dependencies between people or businesses in the same market.
        a. Each person is competing for the same limited resouces in a market, so focusing on how the buyers and sellers compete in a market shows how the resources are exchanged.
    3. Dependencies between markets.
        a. The prices and opportunities in one market affect choices made in other markets.
    4. Dependencies through time.
        a. The choices and investments made today depend on the expectations from the future.
