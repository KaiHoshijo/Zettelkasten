# Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)
DSPs are responsible for dealing with streaming signals, such as audio or video. They encode and decode speech and video (codecs). Through this processor, support for encryption and security is enabled. They used to be embedded in [[IO Modules|I/O Devices]] like modems

They later evolved into Domain Specific Processors (DSP).
