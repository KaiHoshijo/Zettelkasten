# The 4 Principles of Economics
There are four core principles to economics that when applied can systematically improve decisions from an individual or a company. Those principles are:
    1. The [[Cost-Benefit Principle]]
        a. This takes the costs and benefits of a decision into consideration before making a choice.
        b.  Summed up as the question: Benefits beat costs?
    1. The [[Opportunity Cost Principle]]
        a. This accounts for the next best alternatives before making a choice.
        b. Summed up as the question: Or what?
    3. The [[Marginal Principle]]
        a. This considers whether the benefits and costs of more or less.
        b. Summed up as the question: One more?
    4. The [[Interdependence Principle]]
        a. This considers how different decisions affect one another.
        b. Summed up as the question: What else? 

This principle can be remembered as the acronym MCOI, which means marginal, cost-benefit, opportunity costs, and interdependence.
