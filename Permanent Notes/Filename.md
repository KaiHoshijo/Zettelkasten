# Filename
Names in directories are called filenames, which can contain all characters besides slash (/) and the null character (\\0). The slash separates a filename from a [[Pathname]] while the null character termiantes a pathname. Two filenames are created automatically when a new directory is created, which are . (dot) and .. (dot-dot). Dot is the current diretory while dot-dot is the parent directory.
