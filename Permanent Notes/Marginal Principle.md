# Marginal Principle

This principle works on the basis that the decisions are best made incrementally. Breaking down how-many decisions into smaller (or marginal) decisions make them more manageable.

Evaluates the extra benefit (known as the marginal benefit) is greater than the extra cost (known as the marginal cost). According to this principle, one should keep repeating reaping the extra benefit until the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost.

This principle is meant to be applied in an iterative process because it is meant to judge whether repeatedly doing an action is worth it.

This is all based on the **rational rule**, which states to keep doing something worthwhile until the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost.
