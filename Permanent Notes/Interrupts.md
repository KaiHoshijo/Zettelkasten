# Interrupts
- Interrupts are a mechanism by which other modules may interrupt the normal sequencing of the [[Processor]] 
- Provided to improve processor utilization
    - Most [[IO Modules]] are slower than the [[Processor]] 
    - [[Processor]] must pause to wait for the device
    - Wasteful use of the [[Processor]]
