# Analysis Paralysis Description
Through chemical reactions, this project reduces the use of silver used when making new solar panels without losing any effectiveness. Compared to the paste used before, these chemical reactions are more controlled and easier to measure. 

Our field session is to design an application, currently named Lee, in Swift which will run external scripts, either Python or MatLab, and direct the script's output to a specified file directory. This will use default parameters initially, but a stretch goal is to specify parameters when running the script. The application Lee needs to be independent of the scripts, so the application can scale however necessary.
