# Linear vs Non-Linear Equations

Linear equations have the highest power of one while non-linear equations have a highest power greater than one.

```ad-note
Some examples of linear equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1*x_1 + a_2*x_2 &= 5
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + 8 &= 3*x_2 + 3*x_3
\end{aligned}
$$
```

```ad-note
Some examples of non-linear equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi*x + e^2*y = 5
\end{aligned}
$$
```
