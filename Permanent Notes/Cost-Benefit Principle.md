# Cost-Benefit Principle
Before making a decision, one should do two things:
    1. Evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the decision.
    2. Pursure the action only if the benefits outweight the cost.

This principle gets easier by associateing each cost and benefit with its money equivalent. To do this for non-monetary costs, ask yourself:
    How much am I willing to pay to obtain a benefit or avoid a cost?
As long as the amount you'd pay is less than or equal to the actual cost, you should obtain the benefit or avoid the cost. This will always ensure an **enconomic surplus**, which means to enjoy more benefits to costs. 

This principle can fall victim to the *framing effect*, where how alternatives are framed can have drastic effects on the viewer's opinion on the cost or benefit.

Additionally, this principle can avoid selfishness by considering unselfish motivations, which allows for one to be a selfless person while enjoying an economic surplus.
