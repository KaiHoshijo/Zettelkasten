# Variables
The columns each refer a specific attribute, feature, or measurement of the [[Cases]]

For example, in a dataset about how many babies were given each name in each year in the US, the count column would give the number of babies for each case; sex would indicate if the  [[Cases]] is male (M) or female (F)
