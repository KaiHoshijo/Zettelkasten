# Opportunity Cost Principle

This principle has the individual measure costs by what he or she must give up and the consequences lost from the next best alternative.

Moreover, this principle is so important that when economics refers to *costs* they are referring to *opportunity costs*.

A way to consider principle is to think of Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken" since the opportunity cost is measuring whether the road not taken is better than the road currently being taken.

To measure the opportunity costs, consider these questions:
    1. What is the result of pursuing this decision?
    2. What is the result of pursuing the next best alternative?

Here are some key points to consider when calculating the opportunity cost:
    1. Out-of-pocket costs can be opportunity costs.
    2. Opportunity costs don't need to involve out-of-pocket financial costs.
    3. Not all out-of-pocket are opportunity costs.
    4. Nonfinancial costs aren't always opportunity costs.

When calculating the opportunity costs, ensure that [[Sunk Cost|sunk costs]] aren't accounted for since they are present in either decision (the best one or the next best one).

The **production possibility frontier** is a graph that measures the opportunity costs by graphing the two decisions since one can't produe more of one decision without less of another decision.
