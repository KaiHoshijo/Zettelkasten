# Test-Driven Development 
There are four main steps to the Test-Driven Development process.
    1) First, writing a test that fails. This step is where the developers decide on the functionality that they want then they write the tests that will be associated with the process. There shouldn't be any real code written, besides code stubs, during this process.
    2) Writing code that passes the just-written tests. This step is where the developer fills the code stubs from the previous step. These should be well-written and still passing the tests.
    3) Refactoring the code from the tests. This is where the developer updates the code and makes it more readable and easy to scale.
    4) These steps are then repeated for each functionality that the customer wants for the final product.
These tests should be continiously tested throughout the process to ensure that no part of the product breaks.
