# Tidy Data
Tidy data is a data table, where the rows are [[Cases]] and the columns are [[Variables]].

There are rules for determining if a datatable is tidy:
    - The [[Cases]] must represent the same underlying attribute, that is, the same kind of thing. This means that totals can't be included in the cases.
    - Each column is a [[Variables|variable]] that contains the same type of value for each case.
